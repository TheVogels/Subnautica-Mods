My mods for Subnautica.
In the releases tab you can look for a tab to see what you want to download or you can also go in the folder of the mod code and find the release in the folder called Release or Builds.

Release is for the latest release version of the mod and Builds is for the latest build.
Latest isn't the real latest but the latest version from when I changed the repository on the desktop app.

When I commit something and the summary is "da changes" means that I don't really know or want to give it a name/summary.
